# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Each role lives at the repository root (`caddy/`, `docker_compose/`) and follows the usual layout: `tasks/main.yml` for orchestration, `defaults/main.yml` for overridable variables, `templates/` for Jinja sources, `meta/argument_specs.yml` for input contracts, and `meta/main.yml` with the Galaxy metadata required for installs. Mirror that layout when adding new roles and document required vars plus usage in the role `README.md`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
The bundled `ansible.cfg` points at the INI inventory `inventory/default`, so run commands from the repo root without extra flags:
- `ansible-playbook tests/caddy_role.yml --syntax-check` sanity-checks the Caddy role.
- `ansible-playbook tests/docker_compose_role.yml --syntax-check` does the same for the Docker Compose role.
- `ansible-lint caddy docker_compose` enforces Ansible best practices.
- `yamllint .` catches structural YAML issues early.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use two-space indentation in YAML and avoid tabs. Variables stay lowercase snake_case, prefixed with the role name when shared (`caddy_image`). Task names are imperative (“Deploy docker compose bundle”). Templates should rely on explicit filters for clarity. Run `ansible-lint` before opening a pull request to confirm metadata and style remain consistent.

## Testing Guidelines
Sample inventory lives in `inventory/default` and targets `localhost`. Role-specific playbooks in `tests/caddy_role.yml` and `tests/docker_compose_role.yml` hardcode the vars they need and use fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`. Copy that pattern when adding roles, then run `ansible-playbook … --check --diff` to prove idempotence. For broader coverage, add Molecule scenarios under `molecule/<role>/default/` and share any key outputs in review notes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Keep commit subjects short and imperative (e.g. `Add docker compose fixture`).
Group related code per commit. Use pull requests for fixes by default,
including small follow-up fixes. Do not make fixes directly in the main checkout
unless the user explicitly approves an exception. Before committing, run
`git status --short` and verify the staged files match the requested change.
Stage files by exact path when possible. Avoid broad staging commands such as
`git add .` when unrelated local work exists. Pull requests should call out the
roles touched, tests or lint commands run, fixture updates, and any follow-up
work. Link issues when available and request review from maintainers familiar
with the affected role.


## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not commit secrets; depend on vaulted files or environment overrides instead. Review exposed ports and volume mounts in `templates/` when touching Docker assets. Document required environment variables or external services in each role’s README so operators can reproduce the configuration safely.

## Pull Request Delivery Workflow

Deliver repository changes through pull requests by default, regardless of
size. Do not make changes directly in the main checkout unless the user
explicitly approves an exception. Direct commits to `main` or the default
branch should be limited to explicit user-approved exceptions.

Follow this delivery sequence:

1. Create a dedicated topic branch. Use a separate worktree when repository
   guidance requires one or when isolation is useful.
2. Make the requested change and run relevant validation.
3. Update plan progress when working from a saved plan.
4. Run the review gate, fix valid findings, revalidate, and repeat the review
   until it passes.
5. Close the plan when appropriate, then commit and push the reviewed change.
6. Create or update the GitHub pull request with a brief summary and the
   validation commands that were run.
7. Verify required checks and merge when there is no blocking reason.
8. Monitor deployment when applicable, then clean up the worktree and branch.

Do not interpret short requests such as "commit", "publish the change", "ship
it", "push it", or "merge it" as approval to bypass this workflow. Unless the
user explicitly says to work directly on the default branch, skip the pull
request workflow, or make a direct-default-branch exception, continue the
normal flow on the dedicated topic branch, using a separate worktree when
applicable.

Direct-default-branch exceptions still need a clean scope check before
committing. When an exception is approved, state that the normal pull request
workflow is being bypassed because of the explicit exception.

Before committing, run `git status --short` and verify the staged files match
the requested change. Stage files by exact path when possible. Avoid broad
staging commands such as `git add .` when unrelated local work exists.

Include screenshots in the pull request only if a change affects rendered UI,
generated visual output, or external presentation.

## Review Gate

Before committing, use the installed `$branch-review-subagent-loop` skill to
review the complete branch diff. Follow the skill through any required fixes,
validation, and re-review. If the skill is unavailable, ask the user to install
it before continuing.

Create, update, or merge the pull request only after the review gate passes.
Merging also requires green checks unless the user explicitly accepts the
remaining risk.
